            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The hainouſneſs of this Sin I ſhall diſcover in the enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> as being moſt <hi>injurious</hi> to God, <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> to our <hi>Selves:</hi> it carries with it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods <hi>perſon</hi> as well as of his <hi>precept,</hi> and that in a publick manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb facs="tcp:61154:5"/>
one yoke, then is the Church and State beſt governed.</hi> So then, if all the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Gods word were enjoyn'd, as his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> ordered by a Proclamation, <hi>Aug.</hi> 13. 1660. to turn the edge of their Spirits, &amp; declame (at the leaſt once a month) in their Sermons againſt this <hi>Goliah,</hi> this monſter-ſin, and if the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in all places would ſtir up themſelves to a more lively and active execution of the Statute againſt thoſe who ſhall in this ſort preſume to blaſpheme, by taking <hi>Gods</hi> moſt holy <hi>Name</hi> in vain, if this courſe were once ſtrictly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and all Informers againſt ſuch foul-mouth'd blaſphemers encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for their pains, by receiving a part of the mulct drawn out of the others purſes; if this courſe were once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and conſtantly in all places followed, we ſhould find, to <hi>Gods</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and our great comfort, that the fear of ſhame and puniſhment (which with moſt men is more prevalent then the love of God) would chaſe away all profaneneſs from their mouths. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus if a man ſhould converſe with <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and he alleadging for the confirmation of truth the Authority of Gods word, if any one of them ſhould ſtiffely deny what he produces to be a part of the Scriptures, he in this caſe may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſtly uſe an Oath to defend it. An example hereof we have in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who being moved with a Godly and Religious zeal for the Truth, made uſe of an Oath to confirm his Doctrine, that the Churches to whom he writ might be eſtabliſhed in the truth, and God Almighty thereby glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed. The Oath which he uſed is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that clearly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Before God I lie not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Rom. 1.9. 2 Cor. 11.31.</note> which is a Confirmation of his former aſſertion in the<note n="*" place="margin">17.18. ver.</note> foregoing part of the Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had preached the Goſpel in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that he went from thoſe parts to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that he did not learn the Goſpel there of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> or of any other Apoſtle. Now becauſe ſome of the falſe Apoſtles might perhaps retort and ſay (to attache him of falſity, and ſo diminiſh his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that theſe avouchments of his were falſe and fabulous, he therefore juſtifies his Narration or Aſſertions by a kind of Oath, ſaying, <hi>Before God I lie not.</hi> It may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how theſe words can be a form
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61154:13"/>
or kind of <hi>Swearing,</hi> or in what ſenſe they fall under the nature of an Oath. I anſwer, that in an Oath there be four things implyed, though not alwaies expreſſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an <hi>Aſſeveration</hi> of the Truth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond a faithful <hi>Confeſsion</hi> or open <hi>Profeſsion,</hi> whereby the party that is to Swear acknowledgeth from his heart with a firm belief the power and preſence, the omniſciency and wiſdom of God, that he is the only ſearcher of the heart, a diſcerner of the inward Spirit, and that he is both a Witneſſe and a Judge of all our thoughts, words and works.</p>
            <p>The third is a ſolemn <hi>Invocation</hi> of God, that he would be a witneſſe with and to us, that we ſpeak the truth with our Tongues from our hearts.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt is a ſad <hi>Imprecation,</hi> that God would be a judge to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and to inflict a ſore judgement on us if we lie. Now then a formal Oath is a certain frame or compoſition of words, in which not alwaies all, but ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts of it are expreſſed; the other being concealed, and yet to be ſuppoſed and underſtood. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Lord liveth,</hi> &amp;c. There is the forme or eſſence of an oath onely in <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of the life or being of God; which includes his eſſentiall At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61154:14"/>
viz. his Omniſciency and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence, &amp;c. His Attributes are his very eſſence, <hi>quicquid eſt in Deo eſt ipſe Deus,</hi> it is a rule and maxime in the ſchools. The form of ſwearing, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I call God for a record upon my ſoul,</hi> expreſſeth the third particular, namely, <hi>Invocation.</hi> That paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Ruth</hi> chap. 1.17. The Lord doe thus and thus to me, is an <hi>Imprecation.</hi> And the forme in that forecited place <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. is directly a plaine <hi>Confeſsion</hi> that God is preſent as a witneſſe and Judge of our ſayings, and will if we ſpeak not the truth ſeverely puniſh us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a man may uſe an Oath when it ſerveth to maintain or promote his own or his Neighbours ſafety in body, goods, or good name. So to ſave his life, a man may ſwear to a Thief to give him a piece of money at a ſet appointed time, which Oath he is bound to keep, and if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in reſpect to the common good he diſcover him to the Magiſtrate, he is no way guilty of falſity, in that he performs what is every mans private duty, i. e. to preſerve the welfare of the King and State, and to promote the <hi>bonum communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> the common good, which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with a common Thiefs impunity. Therefore I adde, that in caſe a man for fear of loſing his life with his money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61154:14"/>
urged and preſſed to it, ſweares to a Thief that he will not betray him, that man is bound to be ſilent, nor to reveal him in that which concerns himſelf, as having been robbed by him: But if he find and is aſſured that his ſilence may be prejudiciall to the publick good, for that he perceives the licenciouſneſs of the offender proceeds (and is like ſo to do) to the like damage and miſchief of others; he is bound in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (though not to accuſe the Delinquent for the fact done unto himſelf) yet to give warning or notice to ſome in Authority, to have a vigilant eye upon ſo lewd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the preventing of any further Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie. So the late moſt pious and learned Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> determines this caſe,<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> in his Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reſolv. <hi>Dec.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> and annexes this ſaying to his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (to deter all men from perjury or breaking their Oaths) <hi>When once we have intereſſed God in any buſineſſe, it is dangerous not to be punctuall in the performance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that it is lawful in this caſe to ſwear to an High-way Rogue to ſave our life, none will doubt, who ſhall conſider the many inconveniencies and evils which would enſue, if the true man in this ſtreight take not an Oath.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the loſſe of his own life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the loſs of the others ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of Murther in ſhedding that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61154:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mans bloud: theſe dangers may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a promiſe &amp; an Oath of ſilence. But as it is lawful for a man in ſuch a ſtreight to Swear, ſo it is unlawfull for him to break his Oath: for if any one having ſo ſolemnly promiſed by an oath not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Thief (as to that fact of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him) ſhould afterwards make his fact known to the magiſtrate, this miſchiefe would follow upon his diſcovery, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men for his ſake might juſtly be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as if they would doe the like, though they have ſolemnly promis'd or ſworn to the contrary, and ſo it might coſt many a good man his life, when Thieves are put in feare of loſing theirs, being perſwaded that though an Oath be taken, they may be betrayed and given up to the hands of Juſtice. Of the ſame opinion with the forenamed Biſhop is the right reverend Father in God the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenti Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatione.</note> that, if a man falling into the hands of thieves, be forc'd to promiſe, and that by an Oath, not to detect or reveale their robbery of him, and this to preſerve himſelfe from being murdered by them, as he may without offence to God take ſuch an oath, ſo the ſame being taken by him muſt be religiouſly kept.</p>
            <p>But I deſire that this aſſertion may be admitted for a truth with the former qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61154:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſhall only adde this for a Cloſe of this Queſtion, (and it is the ſumme or abridgment of what<note n="*" place="margin">His advice is this, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, A man may ſweare or take an oath to confirm and eſtabliſh peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and another at variance with him: thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſwear to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 21.24. <hi>that he would not deal falſly with him nor with his Son, nor with his Sons Son.</hi> Thus two ſeverall Kings may ſwear one to another upon an agreement or ratification of peace, not to invade one anothers terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories for ſo long a ſpace of time. Thus a <hi>King</hi> takes an oath<note n="*" place="margin">At his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to his Subjects to maintaine their ancient lawes and liberties; and they reciprocally oblige themſelves by a ſolemn oath to preſerve his honour, to defend his perſon, and maintain his <hi>Royall</hi> rights and prerogative, to be obedient to his juſt commands, to be obſervant of his lawes: all this, and more, is implied in the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> which Oath cannot ſtand or conſiſt with the Subjects taking up
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61154:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Armes againſt their Soveraign Lord the King (under what ſpecious pretences ſoever) without the high guilt of Treaſon and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point concerning the Legality or lawfulneſſe of taking an Oath in private and publick Caſes, the meaning of our Saviours prohibition,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> is this, which before hath been touched in few words, <hi>Swear not at all</hi> in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk and familiar diſcourſe, but as Chriſt commands v. 37. <hi>Let your communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be Yea Yea, Nay Nay,</hi> i. e. uſe onely a bare affirmation of what you know to be true, and a ſimple Negation of what you are aſſured is falſe, without interpoſing the ſacred and dreadfull Name of God. <hi>Let your Yea be Yea,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61154:24"/>
goe back to their Father, unleſs they would ſend for their younger Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and he ſeems there to ſwear by a creature, namely by the King, where he ſaies, <hi>By the life of Pharaoh ye ſhall not goe hence, except your younger Brother come hither.</hi> It is not (ſay they) to be imagin'd that <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſo good a Saint, and ſo wiſe a man, would have ſworn by his King, unleſs he had been fully perſwaded in his ſoul (and that by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by whom he was alwaies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned) that to ſwear by the creature was not a ſin, nor derogated any whit from Gods glory, at which he ever aimed. A plauſible objection. To which I anſwer firſt with the learned <hi>Zanchie, Ab exemplo unius quamvis Sancti viri argumentum duci non poſſe contra apertum Verbum Dei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zanch. in Miſcellan.</note> From the example of one particular man, though for his piety never ſo much famed, we may not draw a pattern for our practiſe againſt the expreſs word of God. <hi>Ex fide perſonas, non ex perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis fidem probamus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> We muſt prove or try mens perſons by the Faith, or Doctrine of the word, and not the Faith by mens perſons; i. e.

Suppoſing then that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſwore by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his action muſt not be a rule or pattern for thy imitation. The law
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61154:24"/>
of God, as it is the way wherein we muſt walk, ſo it is the Rule whereby in our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to heaven we muſt be guided. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be probable that <hi>Joſeph</hi> uſed ſuch an Oath that he might comply with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in that forme which, perhaps, was by them uſed, and might alſo do it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to be diſcovered by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren not to be an <hi>Egyptian;</hi> yet my ſecond anſwer will better clear the doubt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the objection. I ſay then in the ſecond place, that it was not properly nor ſimply an oath, but rather an <hi>Obteſtation,</hi> a kind of deſire or wiſh, as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>So may the king proſper as what I have averred is true,</hi> viz. That <hi>you ſhall not goe forth hence except your youngeſt Brother come hither, &amp;c.</hi> This then is not to ſwear by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it is rather, as I ſaid, a deſire and wiſh added to an aſſeveration of a truth. Examples of the like manner of Obteſtations we find in the holy Scriptures. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.55. There <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> ſayes to <hi>Saul, As thy Soul liveth, O King, I cannot tell,</hi> ſo our Engliſh tranſlation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it; but the words muſt be expounded in the ſame ſenſe as thoſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> before, becauſe that the phraſe in Hebrew is the ſame.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> The effect then of <hi>Abners</hi> anſwer to <hi>Sauls</hi> quaere may be this, As I wiſh thee, O King, long life and happineſſe even as this is reall and true, ſo what I affirme is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61154:25"/>
not falſe, &amp;c. The like kind of aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they of old ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the truth of what they affirm'd, we find 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.19. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 25.26. So then admit of which of the two anſwers you pleaſe, it is clear that from the example or practice of <hi>Joſeph</hi> we may not conclude it lawfull to uſe the name of any creature in an Oath. But this we willingly grant, having Gods word for our warrant, that the names of ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be uſed when we ſwear: yet with this limitation, and in that ſenſe only which I have premiſed, viz. Not to ſwear by them abſolutely and ſimply, i. e. to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or call upon them to witneſſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or Truth of our aſſertion, but only ſo, that we wiſh their good and welfare if we ſpeake the truth; if otherwiſe, i.e. if we lie, their miſchiefe and deſtruction.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61154:25"/>
thing (to maintain which we wiſh to our ſelves or others any hurt) is very materiall and weighty; for otherwiſe, i.e. to impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or uſe a form of Curſing for a ſlight matter or for no cauſe, is a great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin, and they who are guilty of it are rank'd in Gods word amongſt the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and Ungodly men.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.14.</note>

Having thus ſhaken the foundation of the Romaniſts pretended reaſons for their Idolatrous Swearing by the Creatures, I paſſe now to the propoſall of ſome better and ſounder reaſons to the contrary, to ſhew the unlawfulneſſe of their practice, and withall their Impiety therein,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61154:26"/>
which is great and hainous. To conclude this point then,<note place="margin">Reaſons why we muſt not ſwear by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> 
               <hi>Swear not at all</hi> by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Firſt, becauſe an Oath ſolemnly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is a great part of Divine Worſhip, as appeares by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.18. where the prophet foretelling that <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be redeemed from the darkneſſe of Idolatrous Worſhip, and brought to the light of the knowledge of the true God, whom they ſhould invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or worſhip in Sincerity and Truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other duties which he reckons up as parts of Gods worſhip there he ſayes, that <hi>five cities in the Land of Egypt ſhall ſwear by the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Not unlike to this of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is that of <hi>Jeremy c.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Thy Sons</hi> (ſo God by him beſpeaks the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Nation of the Jewes) <hi>have foreſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, and ſworn by them which are no Gods.</hi> By this latter part of the verſe he declares or expounds what he had aſſerted in the former, how the Jews had forſaken the Lord, and he ſaies in expreſſe terms, that they ſwore not by the Name of God, but <hi>by them which are no Gods.</hi> And hence I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that ſince to Swear by the Sacred name of God is a piece of religious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, and a thing ſo acceptable to God (when there is great need of it) as that for doing the contrary he denounced againſt the Jews his indignation and wrath; it muſt then of neceſſity be no leſſe then Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry

to transferre that honour to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which is proper and due only to God the Creatour: and this ſin we commit when we uſe their names in any Solemn proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Oath. For (which is my ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove the hainouſneſs of this ſin) when we ſwear by any one, we call him to witneſs the truth of what we ſpeak, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diſcerner of the heart and ſearcher of the Spirit, and in effect we acknowledge that he is not only <hi>omniſcient,</hi> but alſo <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,</hi> as having power to puniſh us with deſtruction both of body and Soul if we willfully lie and aſſert an untruth.

            </p>
            <p>For a cloſe of this point, I ſhall clear a doubt, and anſwer a queſtion. The firſt is concerning that cuſtome of the Primitive Chriſtians in <hi>Tertullians</hi> daies, who uſed to ſwear <hi>Per Salutem Imperatoris</hi> (as we find it recorded in him) i. e. <hi>by the health of the Emperour:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Apolog. c. <hi>32.</hi>
               </note> the Queſtion which ariſes hence is this, whether they ſinned in ſo doing? To this I anſwer, that by this terme <hi>Salutem,</hi> health, they underſtood either God himſelf, the Author of health, and the fountaine of Salvation, ſo might <hi>effectivè</hi> be called the health of the Emperour, being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall or ſole cauſe of it: or we are to conceive that this kind of expreſſion was rather an <hi>Obteſtation</hi> then an Oath properly ſo called,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61154:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that by way of compariſon, or taken comparatively; as if one ſhould ſay, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before God that I ſpeak and love the Truth no leſs with my heart then I wiſh my Soveraign Lord the Emperour to live in health. Such kinds of ſpeech, by the life of the King, by the fortune and health of the Emperour, uſed in the Primitive times, were rather <hi>Obteſtations</hi> then <hi>Oaths,</hi> as is atteſted by St. <hi>Baſil</hi> on the 19. <hi>Pſalm,</hi>

Baſil.</note> &amp;c. <hi>There be ſome kinds of ſpeech which have a ſhew or ſhadow of Oaths, and are not ſuch indeed, but only confirmations of an aſſerted Truth.</hi> There is another doubt concerning that uſuall form of ſpeech which is too too familiar in mens mouths, and that is, <hi>By my Faith;</hi> The Queſtion is, whether it may be lawfully uſed? The learned and moſt pious Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> delivers his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or opinon thus concerning it, out of <q>St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Beware, ſaies he, of that which is not a perfect or compleat Oath,<note place="margin">Serm. <hi>30.</hi> de verbis Apoſt.</note> but a manuduction, way, or inlet to it, as to ſay, <hi>By my Faith:</hi> For when a man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts a Truth in this form, <hi>By my Faith,</hi> it is a ſolemn execration, which is an Appendix, or an additional part of an Oath, and he that ſaies ſo ſpeaks thus in effect, <hi>If what I ſay be not true, I wiſh that God would deprive me of the ſaving gift of Faith;</hi> and God may take the ſame away

at that hour or moment, and benight thy Soul with the darkneſs of diſtruſt or doubt. Be therefore very ſparing in the uſe of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore we are to abſtain from this Form, becauſe it hath in it an appearance of evil, being ſcandalous in regard of the particle <hi>Per</hi> or <hi>By</hi> (which is annexed to it, and prefix'd ever to an Oath,<note place="margin">Ameſius C. de Juramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> whereby we invocate or call immediately on God to be a Judge and Witneſs of what we ſpeak) as for this reaſon it is ſcandalous, in that it may give an offence to the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſo likewiſe it is very dangerous to uſe it upon every ſlight or light occaſion in matters of no moment, for it is a kind of vain and raſh tempting of Almighty God, who may ſuddainly frown upon us in his wrath, and in juſtice puniſh us with a loſs of our Faith, without which <hi>we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved.</hi>

            <p>From all that hath been premis'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extent of Chriſts prohibition, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> we may deduce this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable and certain concluſion, That, as by Swearing by the creature God is diſhonour'd, ſo by uſing his Name in a lawful Oath he is much glorifyed: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when we call on Him to witneſs the Truth of what we affirm, we do openly confeſs that he is an Eare and Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, that he knowes our hearts, that he is a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Truth, and a ſevere Revenger of a lie, that he both can and will puniſh us for it? then which profeſſion (and this we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs when we Swear) what can conduce more to Gods honour, and advance his glory? In the 45. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> God ſpeaks thus of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.22.</note> 
               <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe,</hi> i. e. none beſides me to be honour'd with Divine Worſhip; ſo he explaines his own words <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>

their promiſe confirm'd by an Oath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him; for which Rebellion vengeance ſo purſued them, that he with three Kings more made them to flie their petty Kingdoms.

The latter for the ſame crime againſt <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> loſt his eyes, having firſt ſeen the butchering of his Sons; and now being led into Captivity, his legs faſt bound in fetters of braſſe, he had onely the uſe of his eares left to hear the reproches of his Enemies, and of his perjur'd tongue to entreat for mercy and pitty in the midſt of his pain and miſery.

The firſt wiſhed if it were not true, that he might be burnt to aſhes; the ſecond, that he might be tormented with ſome cruel diſeaſe; the third, that he might be ſmitten with blindneſs. <hi>Narciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> relying onely upon his Innocency, and unable to reſiſt their malice, and maſter their matchleſs Villany, removed and hid himſelf in deſart places for many years. But mark the heavy Judgements of God which in the mean time fell upon thoſe perjur'd perſons. The firſt, by the fall of a ſpark of fire in the night, was with his houſe and family conſumed to aſhes: The ſecond tormented in his whole body with that diſeaſe which he wiſhed. The third beholding theſe fearful Judgements inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his two aſſociates in wickedneſs, and fearing to be made the like example of Gods revenging Juſtice, confeſſed his ſin,

            <p>A third ſtory not to be parallel'd I learn'd of a knowing Gentleman in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> it is of one <hi>Everell,</hi> who many years ſince lived and dyed in St. <hi>Albanes.</hi> He being accuſed before the Biſhops Official for an act of uncleanneſs with a Maid, to purge himſelf of this ſuſpected crime, wiſh'd in open Court, that he might never ſpeak more if he were guilty of that fact.

and diſeaſes, with croſſes and calamities, with ſpiritual deſertions (the ſoreſt of all afflictions) here, and with everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter.

            <head>A Brief APPENDIX Concerning The nature of a <hi>Promiſſory</hi> and <hi>Aſſertory</hi> Oath in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Statutes to which we are ſworn in both the UNIVERSITIES.</head>
            <p>ALthough the words of a <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Oath are for the moſt part to be ſtrictly taken, as they import, not admitting thoſe larger explications which oft-times take place in Deeds and Contracts; yet let me adde a few conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the ſatisfaction of the tender Conſciences of thoſe that have ſworn, or ſhall hereafter ſwear to obſerve the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61154:77"/>
of any Colledge in either of the two famous Univerſities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> by reaſon that the matter of a <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Oath <hi>(viz.</hi> ſomething to be done by us <hi>de futuro,</hi> or for the time to come) is, in regard of the uncertainty of event, ſubject to mutation and variety, hence it comes to paſs that the Obligation (which follows upon ſuch an Oath by which the Jurer has bound himſelf for the future to perform what he hath promiſed) is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſeparable from that Oath: and this is called by the Caſuiſts <hi>Solutio vinculi,</hi> the looſening of the bond wherewith we were once tied. He is a perjur'd man, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not, in taking of an Oath, to perform what he hath promiſed by it; but he is not alwayes perjur'd that performs not what he has bound himſelf to by a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Non omnis qui aliter facit quam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſit in dolo jurat, Aqui.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Qu.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> conſider that in an Oath there are to be underſtood thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Juramenta quae vel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitam vel ſubintellectam habent conditionem non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligantubi conditio deeſt, quia juramentum ex conditione pendet, <hi>Rivet. in explicat. Decal. p. 90.</hi>
               </note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which (through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived uſe and cuſtom that ſway and prevail with men) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be conceived and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe whom the Oath concerns.</p>
            <p>As firſt, in all <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Oaths this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ever to be underſtood, <hi>Si placuerit
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61154:77"/>
Deo, i. e.</hi> if it be not againſt the expreſs Word, or hidden will of God, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, before the Oath can be performed, may manifeſt and diſcover it ſelf in ſome unexpected event. In this caſe a man that hath promiſed by Oath to do ſuch or ſuch a thing upon ſuch a day, if he be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſickneſs, or death, which is Gods meſſenger,<note place="margin">Illud pro fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto reputat Deus quod quidem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo vere vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, ſed non valuit, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implere. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> and brings with it Gods <hi>non placet</hi> for the performance of the Deed; in ſuch a caſe, I ſay, a man is not forſworn. Neither is he who having ſworn to do a thing, doth it not, finding it afterwards to be againſt the written word of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his intent and purpoſe was at firſt bent upon the performance, which had been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, if God had not forbid, and ſo prevented the fact. <hi>Verba juramenti promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis in futurum tempus concepta veritatem ſuam aut falſitatem non habent ex eventu, qui eſt incertus, ſed ex animo Jurantis. Grot. in</hi> 5. <hi>Mat. v.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he that ſwears to keep the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of any Incorporation, Society, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is to be underſtood to oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Oath upon no other condition but this, To obſerve thoſe Statutes which are approved of by the frequent cuſtom and uſe of others (the moſt and beſt) and according to that interpretation which the judgment of his Superiours or Governours hath ſet
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61154:78"/>
upon ſome Statutes, which are obſcure, and admit of a double meaning or ſenſe.</p>
            <p>He that ſhall do otherwiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> He that ſhall punctually obſerve old Statutes worn out of uſe by Time or Age, may diſcover a fond love of <hi>Antiquity</hi> and too much <hi>Preciſeneſs.</hi> And he that in doubtful caſes will not ſubmit to the grave judgments of his Superiors,<note place="margin">Cum enim Inferiores ſuis Superioribus multa debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant exhibere, hoc eſt unum principale, quod teneantur eorum praceptis obedire. <hi>Aqui. 2.2.104. Q.</hi>
               </note> may fall upon another Rock of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> and break the peace of a well-ſetled go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in a Colledge.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe many of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> and <hi>Colledge</hi> Statutes (which tend to Order and Peace) have a penalty annexed unto them in caſe of Neglect or Diſobedience, I cannot omit to adde or ſubjoyn this for the better maintaining of Diſcipline and a peaceable order in Societies, <hi>That a wilfull and conſtant breach of a penal Law or Statute will not quit a man from the guilt of Perjury, although he ſubmit to the mulct or puniſhment.</hi> For, <hi>Obedience</hi> was firſt or primarily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Law-giver or Statute-maker, our <hi>Active Obedience,</hi> which we ought with all care and circumſpective diligence to perform and yield to our Statutes. The mulct or puniſhment was annexed to them as a Spur to quicken our Obedience, and to fright us from ſloth and a ſupine Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61154:78"/>
As the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> was placed by God in the Eaſtern part of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.24. <hi>Vid Aquin.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Q.</hi> 95. <hi>Art.</hi> 1.</note> to guard the way or paſſage to the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> that none ſhould eat of it; ſo the Mulct is ſet or affixed to the Statute that it may be the Better kept.</p>
            <p>However, if through any frailty or weakneſs of body, if through incogitancy, want of due care, drowſineſs, ignorance, or the like accidental infirmities, one chance to omit his duty, if then he willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the penaltie, he ſatisfies the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> though not the <hi>Commanding</hi> will of the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> or maker of the Statute, &amp; is free from perjury; from the dreadful guilt whereof a conſtant and wilful neglect or diſobedience (although you are puniſhed) will not quit thee.</p>
            <p>The former Concluſion or <hi>Theſis,</hi> viz. <hi>That although a man ſubmit to the mulct he is perjured, if he lives in a conſtant and wilful breach of a penal Law or Statute,</hi> may be proved and ſtrengthned by many undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments.</p>
            <p>As <hi>firſt,</hi> from the nature of a Law or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, whoſe end is <hi>bonum commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquin. <hi>1.2.</hi> Q. <hi>92.</hi> Art. <hi>1.</hi> Proprius legis effectus eſt homines vel ſecundum quid vel ſimpliciter bonos effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note> the good of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or the advancement of a Society in order, peace, and piety. Now if our ſubmitting to the mulct were a fulfilling of the Statute,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61154:79"/>
few or none (except thoſe who are more gracious) would obey, but rather ſuffer in their (or rather their Friends) purſes: By which means theſe great and ſad inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences would follow. As <hi>firſt,</hi> innocent perſons would then oft-times ſuffer, the Parent for the Sons default (he being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to defray the mulct.) This is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the nature of Juſtice, which is the ſoul of a Law, and the life of all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> this ill would not redound only to Scholars Friends (ſome of whom may be poor and neceſſitous) but a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief alſo would befal the Colledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live, and have their breeding and maintenance. <hi>Ordo eſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi bonum,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is that <hi>Baſis</hi> on which depends the good of the whole <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> and in it of each particular Colledge or Society. Now what Order would there be (nay rather what Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) if <hi>Students</hi> might act their own wills,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> do what they liſt, and obey the Dictates of their vicious phanſies? And I feare there are too many (ſuch is the corruption of our depraved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) who would rather live at eaſe, hide their heads, and fail in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61154:79"/>
performance of their courſes in all Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and other duties,<note place="margin">Infirmitas pucrorum eſt, &amp; ferocitas juvenum— <hi>Cic. de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect.</hi>
               </note> and rather ſuffer in the purſe, then expoſe themſelves to the cenſure of judicious Auditors, and mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their bodies with labour and paines. This would many do, and this diſorder, together with impiety and looſeneſs, would ſtain the beauty of our now flouriſhing and well-ordered Univerſities, if the ſuſtaining of the mulct alone were the fulfilling of the Statutes. But can we imagine that ſloth and profaneneſs were intended by the Founders of our Colledges? Therefore our <hi>Active Obedience</hi> to the Statutes is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally enjoyned; This (as I ſaid before) is primarily intended, and to this in taking of Oaths we are chiefly obliged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The former <hi>Theſis</hi> may be proved from the nature or quality of moſt or many of our penal Statutes, which require a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and trebling of the mulct, untill the duty be actually performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> though there be a disjunction in the words of a penal Statute, yet there is none in the Oath. For we ſwear <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> without a diſtinction or disjunction to obſerve and keep (to the utmoſt of our power) the Statutes according to their chief intent and purpoſe, and that is an <hi>Active Obedience,</hi> and real performance; this is chiefly <hi>by</hi> and <hi>in</hi> them intended. We
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61154:80"/>
promiſe by Oath to endeavour (laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all <hi>ſubterfuges)</hi> to do what the Statutes command, and for example ſake, <hi>in terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem cateris,</hi> that others may avoid the like offence, <hi>to ſuffer willingly,</hi> in caſe we faile through any unwilful neglect in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our duty which is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to maintain that the wilful and conſtant breach of a Statute, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the impos'd mulct is a fulfilling of it, is in my opinion (which I humbly ſubmit to better judgements) as abſurd, as to ſay, that the Reprobate and wicked miſcreants in Hell fulfill Gods Law by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering eternal pains as a puniſhment for their diſobedience: Or that a Thief is a good ſubject for ſtealing, and then for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the <hi>condemning</hi> power of the Law, by ſuffering death upon a Gibbet. The truth therefore of my fore-named <hi>Theſis</hi> being built or grounded upon theſe four Reaſons will, I hope, appear unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the judicious.</p>
            <p>To conclude, becauſe it is a dangerous and fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, into the hands of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Juſtice, and becauſe the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of a ſtrict obedience is a quiet Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that we may eſcape the wrath of an angry Deity, and enjoy that bleſsing of all
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61154:80"/>
bleſſings, <hi>viZ. Peace of Conſcience;</hi> which ſurpaſſes <hi>all</hi> the riches in the world, and <hi>paſſeth</hi> all <hi>underſtanding</hi> (as is implied in our Churches Liturgical Benediction) let me in the name and fear of God exhort all <hi>Academicks</hi> to weigh with their moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts theſe two particulars of great moment and conſequence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the preſervation of that bleſſed peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> let them conſider that they have promiſed <hi>de futuro ſub juramento</hi> to keep ſuch and ſuch Statutes,<note place="margin">

(which is the cloſe of the Oath implies as much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> out of a great love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to their Soules peace I heartily adviſe them to conſider what they then at the taking of their degrees <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert de praeterito,</hi> and that too <hi>ſub juramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> They <hi>aſſert,</hi> that they have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all duties required before the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their Degrees: which if they have done <hi>in Tanto,</hi> though not <hi>in Toto,</hi> to the utmoſt of their power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>faithfully,</hi> though not <hi>fully</hi> (for which defect they have a gracious diſpenſation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61154:81"/>
from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity)</hi> they then fall not under the heavy weight of Perjury. For the guilt of which in reſpect of our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory</hi> and <hi>Aſſertory</hi> Oaths, which have been I fear too much neglected and ſlighted, for this the two <hi>Siſter-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities</hi> have been in their mourning weeds, Deſtruction and Deſolation having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into our Walls, (which by Gods wonderful mercy and providence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring our moſt gracious <hi>King</hi> unto us are repaied with the reſtauration of Learning and Gods publick Service.) And for dallying with theſe Oaths ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poor Soul hath (I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) many a year after the violating of them, been tortured upon the rack of a wounded Conſcience. However the Oaths themſelves are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for this, as ſome have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Pulpit fondly declared, (diſcovering herein an <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) but rather the <hi>Jurers</hi> careleſs neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, who wilfully and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſlighting our Statutes, ſeldom or never prove good Chriſtians and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but live and die with perplexed Spirits, and in a Schiſmaticall diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ever rebelling againſt the Lawes and Conſtitutions of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</p>
